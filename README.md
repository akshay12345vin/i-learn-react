# i-learn-react
i want to learn react so this is my first react project it is not an app or software its just i start something after
completing my online course on codeacademy about react. i dont know how to convince my developer about this new js library. also this
is great way to start something i create random branch and trow the code in. Front End Developement have groove this days so i want to
learn angular but its kinda hard for me so i found react istead.:smile:
